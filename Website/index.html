		      A social media application for discussing and following certain stocks. It was made to work 
          on a single system and was never released as an application or website for people to access. 
          It reaches out and finds live stock data through JSON files. Each user can create posts and 
          follow other users. Each user must also create an account. I built this program entirely 
          myself from scratch. <br><br>

		        A game designed with the intent of enjoying a world in many different graphics. 
            The first setting is inspired by the Atari 2600 game "Adventure." As you progress, 
            the graphics continually get better and you learn more and more about the world. 
            This was the first big project I ever tackled alone. It contains many flaws but 
            through those flaws I was able to learn and grow as a programmer. <br><br>
